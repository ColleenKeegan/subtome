  <p>
    The reader application is able to register by including an iframe with the <code>src</code> element pointing to <code>https://subtome.com/register.html?name=(Reader Name)&handler=(Subscription handler url)></code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>name</code>is a free form string. (It will be rendered as a string, so HTML will be escaped).
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>handler</code> param is an absolute URL to the page used in the reader to perform subscriptions. Do not forget to add the <code>{url}</code> placeholder in your urls where the url that the user wants to subscribe to will be added.
