      <h1>Developers</h1>
      <h2>Allow your users to subscribe to content</h2>
      <p>
        If your application is able to handle user subscriptions, this section is for you.
      </p>
      <h3>Registration</h3>
      <p>
        Your users will click on subscribe buttons on some <a href="/publishers.html">publisher</a> pages. When they do so, a
        list of the subscription services <em>they</em> used in the past is displayed. This list
        was not curated by us, but stored in their browser (using localStorage) from services that registered their ability to perform
        susbcriptions for that user.
      </p>
      <p>You too can quickly and easily register your application for your users by loading an iframe like this:
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4333876.js"></script>
        Please note that this is completely transparent for the user!
</p>
      <p>The <code>name</code> query string is the name of your application and the <code>url</code> is the url of the hander which will
        be called in your application to perform a susbcription. This url should include a <code>{url}</code> placeholder where the url of the document on which the subscribe button was clicked will be placed.
      <h3>Subscription handling</h3>

      <p>When a user clicks on a Subtome button, he can pick his favorite subscription application. If it's yours, then, a new browser tab will be created and will point to your application's handler <code>url</code> (see previous section). Based on the <code>url</code> you've provided,
      you will be able to extract the location of the page on which the button was clicked.</p>
      <p>
        Your application should then, perform the subscription, by extracting the content it needs. We recomand using the RSS/Atom feeds, but you could also very well extract the links to a Twitter profile for example allow the user to follow that profile. Possibilities are endless.
